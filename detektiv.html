            One more turn and the screw was tight. With his right hand he
            confidently polished the golden company sign which he had just
            attached:<br />
            <em> - Gregg McGreggor Detective Agency - </em> <br />Now he would
            teach the criminal world fear. <br /><br />

            He had always been fascinated by solving crimes. Inspector Columbo,
            Remington Steele, Sherlock Holmes, Jessica Fletcher, Detective
            Rockford, Hercule Poirot and whatever they were called. From them he
            had copied all his knowledge. No TV broadcast had escaped him, no
            case had been too difficult for him, to follow it closely.
            <br /><br />Just when a children's book author without any
            understanding of economics became Federal Minister of Economics in
            his country and young people without any professional qualification
            and without ever having worked in their lives had made it their task
            to educate the nation as party executives, he also gained confidence
            in his own abilities. <br /><br />

            It was only two days ago that he rented his new office on the first
            floor and moved in it. He was ready for his first case and he
            certainly wouldn't have to wait long for it to come. At least that's
            what Gregg thought when he sat down in his executive chair in the
            office, waiting for customers ... waiting ... waiting.<br /><br />

            To shorten the time and because he watched it in so many movies, he
            lit a pipe and took a good sip of the whiskey glass. Completely lost
            in thought, he went to the window and looked out at the busy street.
            His gaze slid over the cars, the traffic lights, the bushes to the
            dumpster and back again. Then he winced. What was that? A woman's
            bare legs? His look swung back to the dumpster. My God! He didn't
            have himself deceived. Really there were two legs sticking out of
            the barrel.
            <br /><br />
            To be on the safe side, Gregg squeezed his eyes shut and opened them
            again. That was incredible. Then he stared back towards the garbage
            container, but he could not see it anymore, as in the meantime a big
            truck had stopped in front of it. The truck's warning light started
            to flicker and Gregg saw how the truck driver climbed out of his
            cab.
            <br /><br />
            Gregg dropped the pipe and ran down into the street. It took a while
            until he found his way through the moving traffic to the other side
            of the street. Then he headed towards the dumpster. But it was no
            longer there. The truck was also gone. Gregg struggled with the left
            hand the hair. In the other hand he still held the whiskey glass,
            with which he no longer felt as euphoric as ten minutes ago.
            <br /><br />
            It was just the opposite. He felt very uneasy and therefore sat down
            on the curb fall. The thoughts swirled confusedly through his head.
            It seemed to him logical that detectives attracted crime, but didn't
            this work out too fast? In the TV series the police first sealed the
            crime`s scene and secured the traces. However, his clues had already
            disappeared before it had really started. Gregg stuck his head into
            the whiskey glass and swallowed the entire content down at once. He
            choked and started coughing violently.

            When naked women's legs came into view in front of him, he felt very
            strange. They were legs like the ones he saw in the garbage before.
            Long, pale legs in red high heels and fishnet tights. His eyes
            followed the legs up to the suspenders that stick out from under the
            miniskirt which was too short peeped. Somehow the woman who belonged
            to it seemed nervous. She showed a kind of uncertainty before her
            posture changed into feigned self-confidence. Then she said to
            Gregg. “Well, Sir, in the wrong place at the wrong time, right?”
            <br /><br />
            “Whaaaaat?” stammered the master detective.<br />
            “Well, a gentleman with such fine costume sitting in the gutter…”
            the woman continued her speech. <br /><br />
            “Yes, no, well, I...I saw something here...” struggled Gregg trying
            to explain the situation. “So,” said the woman, “..whatever you're
            looking for, I see a lot of work here. Look, I'm moving my fur
            business today and I still have to pack all my jackets into my van.
            And just today my two employees got sick. How should I manage all
            this work on my own? Can't you do anything?”, she asked him,
            accusatorily looking at the detective.
            <br /><br />
            “I would be happy to help such a friendly lady as you are,” he
            justified himself. Hardly that he made this fateful statement, the
            woman pulled him up by the arm and made him get to work. “Go ahead
            young man, time is money and today I am really in a hurry. My new
            store is celebrating its opening tomorrow. So get to work. Always
            take an armful of fur coats and put them carefully here in the van.
            In the meantime I'll go and pack up the office stuff.” Having said
            that, she pushed Gregg into the shop.
