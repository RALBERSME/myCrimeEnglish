        What can you really read from someone else's face?<br />
        <br />In NLP (Neurolinguistic Programming) it has been discussed for a
        while whether you can use the <em><b>Eye Movement </b></em> to determine
        whether the the person standing in front of you is lying. If you are
        interested in this topic, you might want to read more about this on this

        <em><b>Face reading</b></em> has become very popular in recent years.
        <br />
        What is it about? <br /><br />
        The face reader looks closely at the features and facial expressions,
        sometimes also the gestures and voice to capture the person in detail.
        From these he wants to gain information about potential, talents,
        challenges and solution patterns.
        <br /><br />
        The whole internet is now full of courses, videos and the like.
        <br /><br />
        According to Wikipedia, face reading has a long tradition. It appeared
        in China 2000 years ago. At that time the technique was called
        <em>Siang Mien.</em> <br /><br />
        But this technique was also known to the ancient Greeks. For example
        <em><b>Hippocrates of Kos</b></em
        >, who lived 460 - 370 BC, observed faces of dying people. Hippocrates
        recognized a connection between a person's character and his physical
        appearance. <br /><br />
        The Swiss doctor <em><b>Paracelsus</b></em> came to the conclusion that
        that everything that happens inside a person also war noticable outside
        as well. <br /><br />
        The doctor and anatomist
        <em><b>Franz Joseph Gall</b></em> created around 1800 a topic called
        phrenology. This was a connection between the human character and the
        shape of his head. This teaching became so popular that in the 19th
        century it also entered into science. <br /><br /><em
          ><b>Wilhelm Heinrich Schüßler,</b></em
        >
        who is now known for the Schüßler salts, discovered that a person's
        mineral needs are reflected in his face.
        <br /><br />The Iris Diagnostics from 1670 by
        <em><b>Phillipus Menes </b></em>determined three signs that determine
        personality and health status of a perso: the pupil, the iris and the
        white skin within the eyes. <br /><br />
        However, profilers should not be lumped together with face readers
        throw. <br /><br />
        The job of a <em><b>profiler</b></em> is to recontruct thepersonality
        profile of a criminal. For example of terrorists, murderers, sex
        criminals. Taking all hints from the crime scene, he tries to get a
        picture of the personality and behavior pattern of the perpetrator in
        order to support the police to catch the criminal.
        <br />
        <br />While the professional works under the
        <em><b>protected job title “case analyst” </b></em>
        ,
        <span style="text-decoration: underline"
          >the term “profiler” is not protected and can be used by anyone. So
          take care.</span
        >

        <br /><br />
        You should therefore not always believe everything that is said in this
        area is served.
